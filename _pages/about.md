He was a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow for Data Curation at the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University (2019-2020), where he developed the groundbreaking Indigenous Languages digital project that reshaped international data curation standards.

- **Senior Research Associate** for Native Bound-Unbound Archive of Indigenous Slavery Project (2022-2024)
- **Collaborator** with the New Spain Fleets HTR project (2024-2025)

- Tupi-Guarani History
- Afro-Paraguayan History
- Colonialism
- Missionary linguistics
- Social history
- Women's history

His multidisciplinary approach focuses on understanding the impact of colonisation on Indigenous, African, and Afro-descendant peoples.

### International Experience & Leadership

He holds a **PhD in Hispanic and Latin American Studies from Sorbonne Nouvelle University** and has lived, taught, and conducted policy work in France, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, USA, and UK.
