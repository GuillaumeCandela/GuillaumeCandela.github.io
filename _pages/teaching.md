My teaching experience spans over 15 years across six countries, covering colonial Latin American history, Indigenous studies, digital humanities, Spanish paleography, and language instruction. I have taught at all levels from undergraduate to postgraduate, and have developed specialized courses on slavery, gender, and Indigenous history in the Americas.
