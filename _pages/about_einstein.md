I'm an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the [School of Geography and Planning](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/geography-planning), Cardiff University, where I have developed the AHRC project proposal "Mapping Enslavement and Forced Labour in Colonial Latin America: Using AI to Unveil Hidden Slavery Sites and Experiences," currently under evaluation. I'm also affiliated with the [Centre de recherches sur les mondes Américains](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/centre/8168) (EHESS, France) and collaborate with Lancaster University's [New Spain Fleets project](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/newspainfleets/?page_id=249&lang=en).

My research focuses on early colonial Paraguay, Indigenous history, and digital humanities. I develop AI-driven methodologies to analyze colonial slavery and forced labor systems, particularly examining the experiences of enslaved Indigenous, African, and Afro-descendant peoples in 16th-19th century Paraguay. I combine Spanish paleography expertise with cutting-edge technologies like Handwritten Text Recognition and spatial analysis to uncover hidden historical narratives.

Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate for the [Native Bound-Unbound Archive of Indigenous Slavery Project](https://nativeboundunbound.org/) at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, and a Teaching Fellow in Colonial Latin American History at the University of Leeds. I served as a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow for Data Curation at the [John Carter Brown Library](https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/) at Brown University (2019-2020), where I developed the groundbreaking [Indigenous Languages digital project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BHf-9nZ6ugSN0uylvSr7rrxBKmaYg4SU&usp=sharing).

I've also held policy positions with Paraguay's Ministry of Culture (2017-2019), where I led UNESCO's Indigenous Languages Year organization and assisted in repatriating stolen 16th-century manuscripts from the United States—work personally recognized by Paraguay's President Santiago Peña Palacios during the [official manuscript return ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPsHkgQQoFM).

I completed my PhD in Hispanic and Latin American Studies at Sorbonne University, my MA at Université Aix-Marseille, and spent time at Universidad de Granada through the ERASMUS program. I'm fluent in five languages (Spanish, French, English, Portuguese, Guarani) and serve on [UKLAH's](https://www.uklah.org/) executive board. I've conducted research and taught across six countries.
