During my CLIR Postdoctoral Fellowship at the John Carter Brown Library (2019-2020), I developed this pioneering digital project that revolutionized how Indigenous language materials at the JCB are catalogued, preserved, and accessed. This initiative established new international standards for data curation of Indigenous materials and represents a landmark collaboration between academic institutions and Indigenous communities.

## Project Overview

This comprehensive digital initiative catalogued and digitized hundreds of historical documents containing Indigenous languages from Latin America and the Caribbean, spanning from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The project was developed in close collaboration with Indigenous community members to ensure ethical and culturally appropriate data curation practices.

### Key Innovations

**Decolonizing Data Curation**: The project fundamentally challenged traditional archival practices by centering Indigenous perspectives in how materials are described, categorized, and accessed. Working directly with Indigenous community members, we developed new metadata standards that respect Indigenous epistemologies and naming conventions.

**Multilingual Access**: Created search interfaces in multiple languages including Spanish, Portuguese, English, and several Indigenous languages, making these materials accessible to broader communities.

**Community Collaboration**: Established ongoing partnerships with Indigenous communities to ensure their voices guide how their ancestral languages are preserved and shared {% cite candela_melia_lenguas_2015 %}.

## Impact and Legacy

The project has had far-reaching impact on digital humanities practices globally:

- **International Standards**: The metadata frameworks developed have been adopted by other institutions working with Indigenous materials
- **Educational Resources**: Created workshops and exhibitions that have reached thousands of students and researchers
- **Community Empowerment**: Provided Indigenous communities with digital tools to access and preserve their linguistic heritage
- **Scholarly Innovation**: Generated new methodologies for ethical digital curation that have influenced academic practices worldwide

### Technical Specifications

- **Platform**: Custom-built on Jekyll with integrated search capabilities
- **Metadata Schema**: Developed culturally-responsive Dublin Core extensions
- **Digitization**: High-resolution imaging with OCR for colonial manuscripts
- **Access**: Open-access platform with community-controlled viewing permissions for sensitive materials
