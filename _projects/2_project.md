Indigenous Echoes is a dynamic social media initiative I launched in 2024 to bridge the gap between academic research and public understanding of Indigenous history in Latin America. With over 5,300 followers across Facebook and Bluesky, this project demonstrates how digital platforms can serve as powerful tools for decolonizing historical narratives and promoting Indigenous voices.
